## Reflections

- 3 year data for sales is used for training. Data was in uncleaned format with date and Sales column combined and was improperly fomatted. After formatting and cleaning data check for stationarity is done.
- The data is non seasonal, non-stationary and with a upward trend. Defferenced one time to make data stationary.
- ARIMA model is used with Optimum values of parameters found using autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation graphs. Model performance is satisfactory.
- Prediction pipelines is implemented with preprocessing of input data.
- UI is created using HTML, CSS and javascript. Form validations (eg: Incorrect date format , empty inputs etc) are established. Entire interphase is done using ajax.
